>   The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

##  Description                         ##
The objective of this project is yo create a communication program in the form of a client and a
server. 
The server launches first by printing its PID. The client then takes the server's PID and the string
 to send as parameters and sends it. Once the serverr has receptionned the string, it prints it.

As bonuses, the server acknoledges every message received by sending back a signal to the client and
 Unicode characters are supported!
